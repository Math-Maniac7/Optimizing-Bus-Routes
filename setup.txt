I'm assuming that we're targeting windows. Not sure if many school districts have linux machines. 
That being said, it's probably easiest to then develop on windows as well. 

make sure you have python3 and some C++ compiler installed. Not sure about the C++ version, but I 
imagine C++ 21 should be good enough.
